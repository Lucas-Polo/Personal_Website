abstract: 'This article aims at illustrating the role that Additive Manufacturing can play in the development of active antennas for space applications. Three relevant examples are considered: a new radiating element for low power consumption in LEO satellites, an iso-phase waveguide cluster to simplify the accommodation of active arrays in GEO payloads and antenna clusters to reduce the mass and cost of GEO DRAs.'
