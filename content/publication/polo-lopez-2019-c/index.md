abstract: 'One of the most commonly found antennas in microwave and millimeter-wave systems are radiating apertures. These antennas can take several forms, such as open-ended waveguides, slots, or horns among others. As for any kind of antennas, a key parameter to be engineered is the directivity. Therefore, the availability of an upper bound of the directivity value for a specified radiating aperture, together with the physical insight on the means to achieve it, can be a useful and valuable information in the antenna design process.'
