abstract: 'This chapter intends to show the strong potential brought by metal 3D-printing to the field of waveguide components and antennas. General co-design guidelines are firstly provided. These guidelines enable to benefit from the advantages associated to metal 3D-printing. The implementation of filters and ortho-mode transducers is considered, together with horns and slotted antennas. Finally, multifunctional periodic structures benefiting from metal 3D-printing are discussed.'
