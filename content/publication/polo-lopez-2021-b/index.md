abstract: 'This work addresses the contribution of evanescent modes to the total power radiated by an aperture antenna. These modes are normally disregarded by many aperture synthesis techniques without addressing in depth their actual effect on the radiation characteristics. Here several numerical examples are presented showing how much power they actually radiate, their contribution to the directivity achieved by the antenna and their effect on the overall performance of practical antenna designs.'
