I am a research engineer (_ingénieur de recherche_) at the Waves & Signals (_Ondes & Signaux_) department of the _Institut d'Electronique et des Technologies du numéRique_ ([IETR](https://www.ietr.fr/en)), at the [INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/insa-rennes-2.html) site. I work in the development of software tools with high computational efficiency for modelling electromagnetic problems, while also providing support to the researchers of the laboratory in projects involving electromagnetic simulation. I addition, thanks to my former positions, I have also a strong background in the design of dielectric-free miniaturized radiating elements for their integration on highly-reconfigurable arrays, as well as in the additive manufacturing of waveguide devices.
